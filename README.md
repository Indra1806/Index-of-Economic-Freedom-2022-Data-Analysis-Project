## 🧬 Project Objective  

> **To explore the intricate relationship between a nation's economic freedom and its macroeconomic performance, and to determine if prosperity can exist without freedom.**

- *Does economic freedom correlate with higher GDP growth?*
- *Do inflation and unemployment reveal governance failures?*
- *How do populous nations perform on the freedom scale?*

|----|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1  | **2022 Economic freedom score**           | This map/visualization demonstrates the index score of all the 176 countries in the dataset |
| 2  | **Top 40 by GDP Growth Rate**                             | This Map demonstrates the top 40 ranking countries according to the 2022 economic freedom index |
| 3  | **Bottom ranking countries in the index**                        | This map demonstrates the bottom ranking countries according to the 2022 economic index freedom |
| 4  | **Index score based on unemployment rate**                            | This column chart demonstrates the unemployment across different countries and its effect on the final index score |
| 5  | **Index score based on financial freedom**                             | This treemap demonstrates the effect of financial freedom on the index score. we can see from the map that, countries in sub-saharan africa have lesser extent of financial freedom |
| 6  | **Index score based on population**                      | This horizontal bar chart demonstrates if population of a country is in anyway affecting the final index score of a country |
| 7  | **Index score based on 5 year on GDP growth rate(%)**            | This gantt bar chart demonstrates the effect of 5 year GDP growth rate % on final index score |
| 8  | **Inflation rate in different countries**                       | This area chart describes the effect of inflation on final standing of a country.as we can see, venezuela has the worst inflation in the world. |
| 9  | **Correlation between inflation and unemployment**                    | This line graph demonstrates the correlation between inflation and unemployment. we observe from the graph that, inflation and unemployment are closely related |
