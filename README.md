## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ **11 Tableau Visualizations** uncovering trends, correlations, and insights  
- 🎯 **Dashboard Filters + Story Points** for guided interactive exploration  
- 🌐 **Global Focus**: Over 180 countries assessed based on real-world indicators  
- 🧠 **Insights Delivered**: From economic growth to financial freedom impacts

## 🧬 Project Objective  

> **To explore the intricate relationship between a nation's economic freedom and its macroeconomic performance, and to determine if prosperity can exist without freedom.**

We sought to answer key questions like:
- *Does economic freedom correlate with higher GDP growth?*
- *Do inflation and unemployment reveal governance failures?*
- *How do populous nations perform on the freedom scale?*

| 1  | **2022 Economic freedom score**           | This map/visualization demonstrates the index score of all the 176 countries in the dataset |
| 2  | **Top 40 by GDP Growth Rate**                             | This Map demonstrates the top 40 ranking countries according to the 2022 economic freedom index |
| 3  | **Bottom ranking countries in the index**                        | This map demonstrates the bottom ranking countries according to the 2022 economic index freedom |
| 4  | **Index score based on unemployment rate**                            | This column chart demonstrates the unemployment across different countries and its effect on the final index score |
| 5  | **Index score based on financial freedom**                             | This treemap demonstrates the effect of financial freedom on the index score. we can see from the map that, countries in sub-saharan africa have lesser extent of financial freedom |
