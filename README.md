## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ **11 Tableau Visualizations** uncovering trends, correlations, and insights  
- 🎯 **Dashboard Filters + Story Points** for guided interactive exploration  
- 🌐 **Global Focus**: Over 180 countries assessed based on real-world indicators  
- 🧠 **Insights Delivered**: From economic growth to financial freedom impacts

## 🧬 Project Objective  

> **To explore the intricate relationship between a nation's economic freedom and its macroeconomic performance, and to determine if prosperity can exist without freedom.**

We sought to answer key questions like:
- *Does economic freedom correlate with higher GDP growth?*
- *Do inflation and unemployment reveal governance failures?*
- *How do populous nations perform on the freedom scale?*
